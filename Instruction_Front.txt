First of all you need node js installed at your PC.
Second, after opening frontend write down following commands-
				npm i --force
				npm run dev
Third, after front end launched, browse to the link which appeared on a console.

NOTE: Their might be issues with paths, or maybe not, if yes just open terminal within cherry_tiggo this should resolve it.
